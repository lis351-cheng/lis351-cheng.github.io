    <h2>Some Interesting Astronomy Knowledge</h2>

    <h3>Formation and basic properties of neutron stars and black holes</h3>

    <dl>
        <dt>Formed from the supernova explosion of massive stars.</dt>
        <dd>Both neutron stars and black holes are the collapsed core of some massive stars.</dd>
        <dd>Typically, a star with a total mass of between 8 and 25 solar masses can form a neutron star. A star with greater mass has a chance of becoming a black hole after its collapse.</dd>
        
        <dt>Neutron stars and black holes are extremely dense.</dt>
        <dd>A neutron star's overall density is comparable to the approximate density of an atomic nucleus, while a black hole's overall density can be even higher.</dd>

        <dt>Pulsars are special neutron stars that can emit rapid and periodic pulses of radiation.</dt>
        <dd>Pulsars are natural cosmic clocks. They are as accurate as atomic clocks.</dd>
        <dd>Not all neutron stars are pulsars. Only those that have strong magnetic fields and rotate rapidly are considered pulsars.</dd>

    <h3>Some fascinating facts about our solar system</h3>

	<ol>
        <li>The sunset looks blue on Mars because of the dust and its atmosphere.</li>
        <li>All planets in the solar system could fit between Earth and the moon.</li>
        <li>The Great Red Spot of Jupiter has been steadily shrinking.</li>
        <li>Unlike the other three gas giants in our solar system, Uranus does not radiate more heat than it receives.</li>
        <li>One of Neptune's 13 moons orbits Neptune in retrograde.</li>
    </ol>
