    <h2>Some Interesting Math Knowledge</h2>

    <h3>A counter-intuitive probability problem</h3>

    <p class="math">
        Assume you are worried that you might have a rare disease and thus you decide to get tested. Suppose that the testing methods for this disease are correct 99% of the time and that only 1 out of every 10,000 people in the general population has this disease. If you have been tested positive, what is the probability that you actually have this disease? 
    </p>

    <p class="math">
        In fact, there is only less than 1% chance that you have this disease. The basic reason of this result is that this disease is so rare that you are more likely to get a false positive than actually have this disease. If you want to compute this probability using Math, you will need to learn <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/bayes-theorem.html">Bayes' Theorem</a>.

    <h3>A continuous but nowhere differentiable function</h3>

	<p class="math">
        <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/WeierstrassFunction.html">The Weierstrass function</a> is a classic example of real-valued function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. It is named after Karl Weierstrass.
    </p>

    <p class="math">
        There are many obvious examples of real-valued functions that are continuous everywhere but not differentiable at some points. For instance, the absolute value function f(x) = |x| is not differentiable at the point x = 0. However, the Weierstrass function is not differentiable at any points while it is still continuous everywhere.
